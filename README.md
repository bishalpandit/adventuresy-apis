# Adventuresy Backend

Backend for Adventuresy App(app.adventuresy.in) built on top of Express JS alongwith PostgreSQL database. Currently working on a service which will use Socket.io for discussion rooms for the adventurers/travellers.


### RoadMap
[&check;] 1. Authentication and Authorization. </br>
[.] 2. Recommendations based on User Logs. </br>
[.] 2. AdvenSpaces - Discussion Rooms for Adventurers. </br>
[.] 3. Adventure Partner Finder.

### Possible Improvement Plans
1. Shifting to Typescript for better error checking.
2. Improve the SQL queries(most possibly by rewiring the table relations)

### Bugs
None rn :)
